# Code
Here is the code for each of the algorithms. The code in the folders which end in "-BIN" output their result in true bytes with 8 bits to a byte, while the other the code in the other folders output their result in ASCII formatted 0s and 1s (1 bit per byte).

For the Random-Stream algorithm, RandomStream.ino is to be run on the Arduino and RandomStream-computer.py is to be run on a computer with Python. Make sure the serial port is set to the corresponding serial port which the Arduino is connected to. RandomStream-computer.py outputs the binary data to a file in ASCII formatted 0s and 1s (1 bit per byte).
